    <h2>What The—?</h2>
    <p>
      Public Space Travel is a podcast dedicated to intersectional
      social/political critique, cultural studies, comedy, and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      It originated from the ideas that: Knowledge ought to be more public as
      opposed to inaccessible due to academic paywalls and lack of resources;
      That democracy is an ongoing and necessary process for liberation; and
      that social justice requires an intersectional, decolonizing and
      anti-capitalist approach.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>We strive for that P R A X I S (Theory and Action).</p>
    <p>
      We talk about current events. Sometimes we play a continuing narrative
      RPG. Sometimes we drink too much coffee and talk about random interesting
      shit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we always come come from an anti-hierarchy/oppression perspective, we
      aim for progressive/radical left solidarity with brothers/sisters/trans
      and non-binary folk of all stripes.
